# Sveltekit with nHost backend.  Auth is all implemented, login, logout, register, forgot password, change password, email confirmation.

Also, custom validation mapped to correct fields on both client and server side validation.

Has tailwindcss setup along with Daisy UI.  

It's just setup enough that the most boilerplate and difficult things are done without putting too much in.
